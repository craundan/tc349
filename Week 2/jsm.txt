      My first impression of jasonsantamaria.com was that its layout was very minimalistic compared to most of the websites I visit, which I think can be very appealing. The large amount of white space is comforting, but there isn’t too much other than the embedded videos that immediately draws my attention. I’m also very unsure what this website’s purpose even is at first glance. I think that maybe a line or two around the navigation bar could clear up a lot of confusion. From what I gather, it seems to be some sort of blog/portfolio where Jason Santa Maria posts various things relating to art, graphic design and other related topics. A few links also lead to what seems to be a previous version of his website.       The black bar at the bottom is both artistically appealing as well as informative, but it seems like it could be a bit cluttered. I think some of the things, like the search bar, could be put in a more convenient place as well.  Some things, like the ‘reading’ section could be a bit more straightforward and informative. I wasn’t too sure at first if they were books he’s done work for or simply books he recommends reading. The website has a very well-defined format to it and things never really seem out of place (except when it links to his older website and the whole layout changes). The amount of text on the website is a bit overwhelming to me when so few images are used. I thought it was somewhat strange that a graphic designer use so few images on his website. Overall, the whole website seems very relaxed, very informative, and very professional. I hope to be able to make a website as well as this someday.
