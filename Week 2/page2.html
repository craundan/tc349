		<h2>Panic.com website review</h2>
		<p>Panic.com seems like a very convenient and straightforward website. The use of icons and other pictures over large amounts of text makes for a comfortable experience that isn’t too overwhelming. Upon loading the website, you are brought to a page that is very minimalistic and clutter-free. The logo is centered at the top so it is clear that it is the company’s logo. Below it is a simple text statement about the company that sums up its purpose well enough. Below that are icons of the different applications that they’ve made.</p> 
		<p>I think that the size and orientation of the applications’ logos might be a bit too close to that of the company’s. There isn’t much that makes the company’s logo stand out other than the fact that it is at the top of the page. The page may be somewhat oversimplified as well. It all looks very nice and clear, but in order to get any information you have to scroll down and/or mouse over things. In a way, it looks a bit more like a poster or some other form of advertisement. It will probably do a good job of drawing people in, but if people are visiting this page for business reasons then they may not want to be bothered by this form of presentation. About halfway down the page it links to their blog and their online store, which both have slightly different layouts. I think this somewhat breaks the flow of the website, but those pages are a lot more informative and text-based than the main page. </p>
	<p>	In a way, this website seems somewhat like a book with an attractive cover. Looking at the front only tells you the basics, but if you go further in you can see what it has to offer. Some of the pages, like the ones when you click on the application icons, actually seem like they might have too much information. All of the help and social group options are located at the very bottom of the page, which I think is a good idea because it keeps them out of the way of people who don’t need them. Overall, the website looks incredibly nice and simple, which may bring people in, but it also might alienate viewers looking for more information.
