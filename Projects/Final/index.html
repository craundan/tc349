<h2>Experimenting with website styles.</h2>
<p class= "date">3/12/2012</p>
<p>I've decided to go with a glowy neon theme for the site. I'm not completely sure I'll stick with it, but I like it enough to use it now. 

In other news, the game I'm working on is due for playtesting tomorrow. I think we'll be pulling an all-nighter to get it ready. After this Wednesday I'll be able to rest for a bit though.</p>

   <h2>Welcome!</h2>
   <p class= "date">3/10/2012</p>
<p> Welcome to my new website! I plan on having a portfolio page which showcases all of my artwork and work experience, an 'about' page with information about my personal life, and a page of personal interests and links to things I find interesting. I also plan on keeping and updating a blog of sorts. Expect occasional updates!</p>
