For my choice of web development software, I decided that I would use Adobe Dreamweaver. I made this choice because I am already most familiar with it, as well as adobe software in general. I took a beginner web design class (CAS 204) last year and we almost exclusively used Dreamweaver. I found the split between code and design views to be very useful, but I still plan on using chrome to test most of my files to avoid any issues.  I can use the Dreamweaver view to check simple things like fonts, but to make sure the final product is right IÕll want to test it on a real browser.	Though iTerm seems very similar to the standard Terminal application on the Mac, I think it looks a bit nicer and somewhat more user-friendly. I also think it might be a lot easier to follow along with class examples if IÕm using the same software. I liked how everything in iTerm in the example videos was color-coded. Hopefully I will be able to get that working on mine.
