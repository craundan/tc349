      Unitedpixelworkers.com is a T-shirt sales website presented primarily with the gallery design style. They create pixel art of various things and sell them on T-shirts. They also have a blog and podcast and host job listings for web designers and developers. The layout is simple and straightforward. If you’re visiting the website for a T-shirt, you will be able to find it very quickly because their homepage is covered all over with them. The sidebar and the search bar are both also made easily available, so it is easy to narrow your search down. I almost think that there might be too many items on the page.        The layout is very simple. There are a lot of different websites with this simplistic feel, and after seeing so many of them I’m starting to think it’s a bit uninspired. I think that the navigation bar at the top was well-constructed and all of the links are useful. Their ‘podcast’ page could use some more content, but it seems relatively new so they’re probably working on that.  The job postings were pretty neat. I wouldn’t expect a combination of a shirt store and a job posting site in one website. I think that the single-column format works well for the non-store sections of the site. In short, Unitedpixelworkers.com is an unusual website that is very straightforward, interesting, and easy to navigate, but its simplicity makes it very similar to other simplistic websites.
