I think that MSU’s homepage shows a lot of good design choice.  The overall layout and color scheme looks very nice and fairly consistent. The sheer amount of information that this website presents is a bit overwhelming though, and it is easy to get lost. I’m not exactly sure how you would go about fixing a problem like that though, because all of the information is fairly necessary for a college website. The homepage is kept rather simple and the changing pictures do well to grab your attention before you delve deeper into the more specific text-based pages.       The navigation bar is a huge help with moving through the site. A few links lead you to other sites without warning, which I didn’t really like, and some links change the navigation bar slightly, which could get confusing. On the other hand, the different types of layouts help to differentiate between the different topics that they’re about. The athletics pages look a lot different than the original pages, but this isn’t that bad because MSU athletics is much different than MSU academics. Overall, I think that this website is very well-designed for the amount of information it’s trying to present.
