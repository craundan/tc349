      I’ve had some experience with using Etsy in the past, and for the most part I found it to be a rather enjoyable, straightforward, and easy to use website. A lot of the site is made up of images of the products for sale there as opposed to large amounts of text, which makes it fairly easy to browse or search for something specific. The navigation bars are unobtrusive, yet helpful if you need to narrow your search down somewhat. Although nothing really ever gets in the way, I kind of feel like sometimes nothing really stands out either. This may be intentional for the most part in order to give a lot of the artists a fair shot at getting customers. If Etsy has an important blog post or something that they would really like me to see, however, I might miss it completely.       The amount of options you have when browsing is enormous, and I think it might even be somewhat overwhelming. It might be nice if there were more ways to narrow them down though. I suppose there’s an equilibrium to be met between having a lot of helpful options and being more straightforward and simplistic. That’s where the search function comes in. If you know exactly what you want, the search bar is incredibly helpful, and once you’ve found what you want, it’s very easy to go about purchasing it. Each item for sale has a page which contains detailed information about the product, ways to customize your order, and a few similar items in that seller’s shop.  It is for these reasons that Etsy is a great and very useful website that is very well designed.
