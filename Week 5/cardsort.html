<h2>My Findings</h2>
<P>I suspect that my results from the card sorting were the closest to the actual layout of the website because I was the only one with experience with the website beforehand. I tried not to think about what I had seen while sorting the cards, but it may have still had an influence on me. This is why it's a good idea to have unbiased participants as well. It was also quite difficult to separate the website into sections. Some things seemed like it was obvious that they should be together(Like 'Share' 'like' 'tweet' and 'pin it') but I left them separate to see if I might be surprised. My personal results were somewhat different in that I grouped all of the videos together as well as the gift certificate-related things. The other participants had a few similar ideas, which could be useful information if I was actually to redesign this website.</p>
	<p>Many of us had groups that were similar enough to be considered the same thing. Some were close, but not close enough. Overall, I think we got a helpful amount of information out of this. I'm curious about the limitations of a technique like this. Many videos were put into similar categories, but that doesn't necessarily mean they should be in the same parts of the website. I think that this technique might be more useful for sites that have a lot of categories and subcategories for navigation in their menus. </p>
