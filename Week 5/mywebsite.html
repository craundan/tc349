	<p>I plan to continue working on my personal website/portfolio website until it is impressive enough to use to present my work. I may or may not take it in a more professional direction. I think it might actually look good to businesses if I keep it semi-casual. A small glimpse into my personal life as well as my work would allow them to see me as both a good person and a good worker. It could also add a lot more content to the website and show people a little bit about how I do my work. It may even be appealing to people for non-portfolio reasons as well.</p>

<h2>My Findings</h2>

<P>This process went a lot smoother than the process for the foldableme.com. I suspect that that might be because I know the process. It's also likely because my website is still being made, I know what each part of my website should be, and my website is a bit smaller. My participants were the same too, so they had some card sorting experience behind them this time. Some things were pretty straightforward, like the 'about me' section, which everyone said should contain information about my family, my friends, and myself. Others were either agreed upon by about half of the participants or weren't agreed upon.   </p>
	<p> I'm not entirely sure if I'll be using all of these ideas for website content, but I wanted to test them anyway, just in case. I found that some of the items weren't easily labled by participants. It was interesting to see how they all decided to put the website together differently, and I'll be sure to use their input when building it. Card sorting should prove very helpful to me and will probably make my website a lot more user-friendly.</p>
