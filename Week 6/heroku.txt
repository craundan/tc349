      I found Heroku.com to be a very appealing website both visually as well as functionally. The whole website had an edgy dark feel to it, but it also seemed pretty fun and interesting at the same time. Its mostly purple and black color scheme was fairly consistent and pulled the website together quite nicely. Some people might have an issue with how dark the pages are, but I enjoy it. It’s actually pretty refreshing to see a professional site that doesn’t primarily use whites and bright colors.I originally came to the website not knowing anything at all about what it was, but their straightforward and user-friendly layout explained that to me fairly well. They have detailed explanations of how all of their stuff works as well as an intuitive layout for all of it. Much of the information does require some basic knowledge of web design though.	The ‘Dev Center’ and ‘Add-ons’ pages deviate somewhat from the style of the rest of the website, which I guess might not be too bad for things that are significantly different that they might want to point out.  The add-ons page is very similar to the rest of the website, but its color scheme is green and it lacks a lot of the details that make the main part interesting. There are also a lot of different icons on this page. I’m not sure how else they could represent this much information, but it does seem a bit overwhelming. It’s nice that they gave a general description of each add-on and sorted them by function though. Overall, I thought this website was really neat and pretty original while still being simple and straightforward.I decided to stick primarily with a single-column layout for now until I get acquire some more worthwhile content for my website. I experimented with double-column layouts though and I thought they looked really good. I think that gallery layouts are a good idea for my art pieces, but I'm not sure if having one part of my website in a different layout is a good idea.
