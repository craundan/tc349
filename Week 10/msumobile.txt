      I used my iPhone in order to more properly review MSU’s mobile site, as viewing it on a desktop computer’s web browser would have not shown it as intended. Overall, I thought that it was a pretty nice website. It was very simple and straightforward, which is convenient, and emphasizing convenience is especially important for mobile users.  All of the categories for browsing are placed neatly on the homepage, and you don’t even need to scroll. The color scheme is simple, but works well, and the icons are also simple but informative. One difference between this and the main website, however, is the amount of content made available.  There is a lot less information available on the mobile site than on the full site. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, because mobile users often don’t need to be bothered with little details. They usually come to find something specific. It might help to add a bit more than a search bar to the ‘people’ page though.       The ‘news’ page has a lot of information that I think a mobile user would be interested in, but it’s a little disappointing that clicking on the articles takes you to non-mobile sites.  The ‘about MSU,’ ‘Libraries,’ and ‘Video’ pages are very impressive with the amount of content they have. I feel like the athletics page could use some more useful information other than the twitter accounts, but it’s not entirely necessary because they link you to their own mobile site. In summary, I think that this site is pretty well-constructed and could be pretty useful to a mobile user, but some of the sections could have a bit more content to make the mobile experience easier.
