Happycog.com is a really nice looking website that is also very straightforward about what it wants to present. Right away, I saw that the main page was incredibly well organized and free of clutter. It has a very simplistic feel to it, and I think that makes it really easy to figure things out. I love how all of the buttons in the navigation bar simply scroll you down the page to their section instead of loading another page.  I could see that possibly being considered a waste of space, since they could just scroll down the page, but the page makes great use of its space, so there isn’t a problem with doing something fun and convenient with those buttons.       It’s a little strange that you can’t get to some other pages from the top of the homepage though. Other than the one button at the top you can use to contact them, you have to visit certain sections of the page in order to get the links to other pages. As a first-time visitor, It might be nice if the purpose of the website was one of the first things I could see on the page, but I think that people who are already familiar the website might find that inconvenient. They seem incredibly open-ended with what they do and they seem to be able to take on a variety of jobs. Perhaps they could emphasize that, because It’s difficult to pinpoint what their main purpose is. More pages about their accomplishments in design could also give me a better idea of their work. These are just thoughts and minor gripes, however.  Happycog.com is an incredibly well-designed website that is very easy to use and appealing to the eye.
